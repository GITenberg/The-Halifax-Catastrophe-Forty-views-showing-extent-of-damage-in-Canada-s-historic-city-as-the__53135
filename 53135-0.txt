                              INTRODUCTION


Thursday, December sixth, 1917, will be ever memorable as the date of
the great disaster which, with catastrophic suddenness, burst upon the
beautiful and old historic city of Halifax, causing widespread
destruction, death and desolation, the magnitude of which finds no
parallel in our history. The fateful morning dawned both fine and fair,
and the normal activities of the busy city were set in motion for the
day. No one dreamed that in the magnificent harbor of Halifax the
opening scene in a terrible drama of tragedy was already staged.

Proceeding up the harbor, and making for Bedford Basin, was the French
steamer “Mont Blanc,” carrying a deck cargo of benzine and an under
cargo of some three thousand tons of nitro-glycerine, and the world’s
most powerful explosive, “T. N. T.” Leaving the upper harbor and
steaming at slow speed was the Norwegian steamer “Imo,” with a cargo of
relief for the war sufferers of Belgium. Slowly the two vessels
approached each other; nearer and nearer they drew, reaching the Narrows
between the harbor and Bedford Basin, at which point they should have
passed. Then happened the inexplicable—save for the fatal phrase
“Someone had blundered”! The Norwegian vessel collided with the “Mont
Blanc,” and almost immediately her deck cargo of benzine caught fire and
a few minutes later, at five minutes past nine to be exact, the three
thousand tons of high explosives aboard exploded with a dull
reverberating roar and a crash that defies description. In a second of
time it was as though a fierce tornado had swept the City. The whole
North End, practically two square miles of territory, became a burning
ruin. A considerable section of the water front was completely
shattered, and all over the city, public buildings and private dwellings
were wrecked, and not a window remained anywhere intact.

The preponderating magnitude of the calamity can be somewhat realized by
the terrible toll of dead and wounded. The casualties were truly
appalling—1,200 dead, 2,000 or more wounded, and 6,000 rendered
homeless. Property damage was estimated to be between Forty and Fifty
Million Dollars.

The scenes following the great convulsion are utterly beyond the power
of language to describe. Chaos reigned supreme, and our vocabulary fails
to depict the heart-rending scenes witnessed on the streets and in the
hastily improvised hospitals and morgues. Gallant acts of amazing
heroism are recorded, and Halifax will never fully know all she owes to
the military and naval forces stationed in the city for their
magnificent services, so promptly rendered in the hour of her dire
disaster.

No sooner had the appalling news flashed across the cables than messages
of sympathy and offers of practical aid poured in from all parts of the
Dominion and the U. S. A. The local Relief Committee was inspired and
heartened by the prompt despatch from Boston of a special relief train,
bringing a corps of doctors, surgeons, and Red Cross nurses with full
equipment, under the direction of Hon. A. C. Ratchesky, the personal
representative of Governor McCall of Massachusetts. Premier Borden
arrived in Halifax on Friday morning, and issued the following statement
expressive of the keen appreciation which all Canada felt at the
magnanimous assistance of the American people:

  “The people of Canada are profoundly grateful for the generous
  sympathy of the people of the United States in the terrible disaster
  which has overtaken the City of Halifax, and they most deeply
  appreciate the splendid aid which has been offered and sent from so
  many communities of our great kindred nation.”

In an incredibly short space of time, considering the tremendous nature
of the calamity, confusion took on the semblance of order, and the eager
hands of willing citizens were busily engaged under the direction of
committees in ministering to the maimed and injured, reverent burial of
the untimely dead, catering for the hungry and providing for the
thousands rendered destitute and homeless through the sudden stroke of
swift catastrophe which has laid the city low.

Not yet, at this hour of writing, has Halifax recovered fully from the
shattering blow of that fateful Thursday, the sixth of December; but
with optimistic fortitude, with courage and with ardor, is already
grappling with the Herculean task of reconstruction; and thus it is that
the gloom of the present is even now radiantly relieved with the gleam
of a splendid vision—The Greater Halifax of Tomorrow. Surely here is
ample evidence that there is something in man, frail and human as he is,
which nevertheless defies and rises above catastrophe.

                                                          HAROLD T. ROE.

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
